###INTRODUCTION

Heart disease is the most deadly disease in the world. Yet it is typically detected too late in life due to incorrect detection practices. 
Early Prevention Using patient data to develop accurate risk prediction models using a collection of medical records, which serves as the basis for a heart disease prediction model.
Predicting heart disease involves the sample analysis, blood testing, and image processing are some of the processes used to predict cardiac disease. 
Everything is possible with Machine Learning. Each Machine Learning model offers to provide positive results. 
Everything depends on the dataset used and properly maintained, high- quality datasets produce accurate results. 
Machine learning algorithms are increasingly employed to remove human error and support medical professionals in thoroughly examining medical data. All things considered, heart disease prediction through Machine Learning algorithms is an advanced approach in cardiovascular medicine that has the potential to completely transform clinical decision-making, risk assessment, and patient treatment.
Healthcare systems may proactively identify individuals at high risk of heart disease, implement targeted therapies, and eventually improve population-level health outcomes by leveraging the power of data-driven insights and predictive analytics. 
Biological expression of data analysis, using methods such as Confusion Matrix, Accuracy, Precision, and Recall, and algorithms such as Logistic Regression (LR), Decision Tree (DT), RandomForest (RF), SVM, KNN, and NB, serves as the foundation for cardiac disease prediction models.
